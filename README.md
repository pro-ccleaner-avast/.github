## Key Features of CCleaner Pro:
1. Automatic Updates:
One of the biggest advantages of CCleaner Pro over the free version is automatic updates. The Pro version ensures you always have the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates without manually checking for updates.

2. Real-time Monitoring:
Real-time monitoring in CCleaner Pro allows the tool to detect and clean junk files as they accumulate, rather than waiting for you to run a cleanup manually. This helps maintain system performance without having to remember to run the app regularly.

3. Advanced Registry Cleaner:
The Pro version comes with an advanced registry cleaner that scans your computer for errors and broken registry keys. This can help resolve issues like slow startups, crashes, or application errors caused by outdated or corrupted registry entries.

4. Scheduled Cleaning:
With CCleaner Pro, you can schedule automated cleanups. Whether it’s daily, weekly, or monthly, the software can clean your system automatically at the times you specify. This ensures that your system remains optimized without you needing to intervene.

5. File Recovery (Premium):
In addition to regular cleanup, CCleaner Pro offers file recovery functionality. If you accidentally delete an important file, CCleaner Pro can help you restore it, as long as it hasn’t been overwritten by other data.

6. Privacy Protection:
CCleaner Pro helps protect your privacy by cleaning up browser history, cache, cookies, and other personal data from multiple browsers and applications. This makes it a useful tool for maintaining privacy on shared or public computers.

7. Faster System Performance:
By removing unnecessary files, clearing out old logs, and optimizing system settings, CCleaner Pro helps speed up your computer’s performance. It can also manage startup programs, ensuring that only essential apps are running when your computer boots up.

8. Duplicate File Finder:
CCleaner Pro includes a duplicate file finder that helps you identify and delete duplicate files, freeing up space on your drive and organizing your files.

9. Premium Support:
Pro users get priority customer support, meaning quicker responses to any issues or questions you might have about the software.
